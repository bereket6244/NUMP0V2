find that four digit number. You start by submitting your guess like 
you see here

Then the game tells you the amount of matching digits it has and how 
many of those numbers are in the correct position. Amount of correct 
digits is displayed on the first light blue squares the amount of 
correct positions is stored on the second light blue squares like so

here i guessed 1234 as my initial guess and the game told me that two
of those four digits match the one that your supposed to find and out 
of those two only one is in the correct position. 
Note
. You can not input the same digits for when youre trying to submit a 
guess
. You have to input all four digits to be able to submit a guess 
. The number you have to find never has similar digits 

ps. The history is not functional yet.
